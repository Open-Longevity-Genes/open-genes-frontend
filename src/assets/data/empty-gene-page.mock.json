  "commentEvolution": "NLRP3 is a family member of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs). The mammalian NLRP3 is structurally characterized by the presence of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a central ATPase domain known as NACHT, a domain associated with NACHT in fish and other vertebrates, and a C-terminal LRR domain. NLRP3 homologs with the same function were described in teleost fish and birds [1, 2]. NLRP3 homolog was also found in a sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Structural analysis revealed that AjNLRP3-like processed characteristic domains of pyrin  and NACHT. A. japonicus feature similar inflammatory events as those in vertebrates, related to activation of AjNLRP3-like protein [3].",
  "proteinDescriptionUniProt": "This gene encodes a pyrin-like protein containing a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. This protein interacts with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein PYCARD/ASC, which contains a caspase recruitment domain, and is a member of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. This complex functions as an upstream activator of NF-kappaB signaling, and it plays a role in the regulation of inflammation, the immune response, and apoptosis. The SARS-CoV 3a protein, a transmembrane pore-forming viroporin, has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the formation of ion channels in macrophages. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditarian, and deafness, autosomal dominant 34, with or without inflammation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene. Alternative 5' UTR structures are suggested by available data; however, insufficient evidence is available to determine if all of the represented 5' UTR splice patterns are biologically valid.
